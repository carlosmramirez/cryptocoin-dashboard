# Getting Started with CryptoCoin-Dashboard

This application will allow any cyrpto investor to track crypto coin prices and market data, track your crypto portfolio, and stay up to date with recent crypto news. The CoinGecko API(https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api) is leveraged to fetch crypto data and the News API(https://newsapi.org/) is leveraged to fetch crypto news data.

Further development plans include: Adding capability to graph mulitple coins, changing standard conversion currency from USD, adding a positive/negative icon from last fetched value for coin tickers, feature to add new coin to watchlist, refactoring portfolio graph to show change in portfolio value over time, fetch user portfolio data from a database to populate breakdown, allow user to search specific keywords for news data, and add more responsiveness/mobile compatibility. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
